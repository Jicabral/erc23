# erc23
ERC23 is a Token based on Ethereum, a Pay-to-Service Token. It is a decentralized platform that gathers information, events and news about tokens. It is also a tokens forum. A token used to pay for services.


We will create an information platform and forum about tokens, where users will be able to communicate with each other and ask questions about tokens. Our focus is Tokens. There will be news and it will be a place where the investor can draw his conclusions on which token to invest.
It will be a space for news of tokens, calendar of events, forum of debates and information. All about tokens. Our project is exclusively regarding tokens.
Some services on our platform will be paid, and restricted to the investor. Our tokens will be used to pay for some platform services. After, all tokens used will be burned. 
ERC23 stands for 'all tokenized tokens', since all of them will be represented by ERC23.
We will formalize our project as a real company. Thus, you will have all rights and duties to users.
A reliable place where the investor can draw their conclusions before investing their money.

Future and Perspective

We will have a great future. We intend to be a reference in the subject of tokens. Our team is working hard for our project to take off until the moon. Every day, every hour we will gather information and we will pass it on to our readers. We will be connected all the time. We will be connected to forum moderation and the crypto calendar. The contact service will work during business hours. 
We intend to be a reference in the tokens segment. A reliable place where everyone can communicate, exchange ideas, learn about tokens. We will also provide a calendar with crypto world events.

ERC-23 is a token of the Ethereum platform. It has a total supply of 100M. The contract is 0xc435651cbf97da401da6f6e657b94e0de5cfe989.
ERC23 Tokens will be used to pay for the services of our platform and they will all be burned. This will make the tokens in circulation decrease, making it a great investment in the long term.
Our tokens will be on sale at Poloniex and EtherDelta exchanges for now. But we will find more exchanges soon.
